Here's a project description for the Python script you've provided, which builds and saves a machine learning model for Iris flower classification:

### **File Description: Iris Model Training Script**

#### **Overview:**

This Python script is used to **train and save a machine learning model** that classifies Iris flowers into one of three species — *Iris-setosa*, *Iris-versicolor*, or *Iris-virginica* — using the popular **Iris dataset** from `scikit-learn`.

#### **Main Components:**

1. **Dataset Loading:**

   * Loads the Iris dataset using `load_iris()` from `sklearn.datasets`.
   * Converts the dataset into a pandas DataFrame for better handling and readability.

2. **Data Splitting:**

   * Splits the dataset into **training** and **testing** subsets using `train_test_split`, with 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing.

3. **Model Training:**

   * Uses a **Logistic Regression** model from `sklearn.linear_model`.
   * Trains the model on the training data with `max_iter` set to 200 to ensure convergence.

4. **Model Evaluation:**

   * Prints training and testing accuracy to evaluate how well the model has learned the classification task.

5. **Model Saving:**

   * Saves the trained model using `joblib` in the `model/` directory as `iris_model.joblib`, making it ready for deployment (e.g., via a Flask web app).

#### **Technologies Used:**

* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* joblib

#### **Purpose:**

This script prepares the machine learning model used in the Iris flower classification web app. It encapsulates the end-to-end process from data loading to model training and persistence, ensuring the model can be reused without retraining.
